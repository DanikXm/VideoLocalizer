00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,880
 Welcome back to another episode of Podcast and Chill. We're so excited to have you here

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,040
 on the Learn English Podcast Channel. Last time, we talked about ways to improve your

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,920
 memory, and it seems like you all loved it. Yes, and we received so many comments from

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,320
 you about how helpful it was. Memory is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,840
 training your brain. That's true. Keeping your brain sharp is as important as keeping

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,640
 your body fit. So, that brings us to today's topic. How to train your brain. We'll discuss

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,440
 some simple but effective ways to boost your brain power and keep your mind active.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,320
 Plus, we'll share some fun techniques and tips to make brain training enjoyable. Don't

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,800
 forget, there's a free PDF with key takeaways from today's episode, so make sure to download

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,200
 it. Alright, let's dive in and get started.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:16,400
 Alright, Gwen, let's get into it. Why is brain training so important? Well, think of it

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,640
 this way. We train our bodies to stay healthy, so why not our brains? That's a great point.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,920
 A strong brain helps with memory, problem solving, and staying focused, especially when

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,080
 learning English. Exactly. I read a study from Harvard that showed activities like learning

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,360
 a new skill can improve brain function and even delay aging. Learning new skills, like

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,200
 what? It could be anything. Learning to play the guitar, trying out a new recipe, or

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,560
 even picking up a language like English. I've been trying to learn how to juggle. Does

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,320
 that count? It does. Juggling improves hand-eye coordination and concentration.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,120
 So learning something new keeps the brain active and sharp. What about memory exercises?

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,440
 Memory exercises are great. For example, try memorizing a list of words or using the

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,000
 memory palace technique. Memory palace? Sounds like a place I'd love to visit.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
 It's not a real palace, Leo. It's a method where you visualize a place and store pieces

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,320
 of information in different rooms to recall them later. That's so cool. I'm going to try

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,480
 it with my grocery list. Another fun exercise is using rhymes or songs

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,760
 to remember things. For example, think about how kids learn the alphabet with the ABC

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,040
 song. That melody sticks in your mind, and you remember it for years. You can apply

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,880
 the same idea to learning English words or phrases. For instance, you could create a simple

28
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:56,440
 tune to help remember irregular verbs like go, went, gone, or see, saw, seen.

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,799
 Oh, and don't forget about listening to songs in English. Songs are a great way to learn

30
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:07,040
 because they combine words with rhythm and emotion. Exactly. For example, singing along

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,600
 to let it be by the Beatles can help you practice simple phrases and pronunciation. Plus, when

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,079
 you sing a song you like, you're more likely to remember the words. That's true. I used

33
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,500
 to sing, we will rock you by queen all the time. And now I'll never forget the phrase,

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,880
 you got mud on your face. Another example is rhymes. You can use rhyming phrases to memorize

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,720
 tricky things like prepositions. For instance, on the table, not in the air, under the chair,

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,880
 not over there. That's brilliant. It's like turning studying into a game. And it works

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,480
 for people of all ages, not just kids. So whether you're creating your own tunes, or

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,200
 borrowing from your favorite songs, music and rhymes, make learning more fun and effective.

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,680
 And don't forget about learning through association. You mean like connecting a word to an image

40
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,760
 or story? Yes. For instance, if you're learning the word tree, picture a tree in your mind,

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,480
 or think of a memory involving a tree. That's a powerful way to remember vocabulary. Speaking of

42
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,600
 memory, I heard exercise can boost brain function too. Absolutely. A quick walk or even yoga can

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,560
 increase blood flow to your brain, helping you think more clearly. Did you know that research

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,960
 from Harvard Medical School shows that physical activity boosts the production of chemicals in the

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,160
 brain that improve memory? Yes. Simple activities like yoga or a brisk walk can increase blood flow to

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,200
 the brain. This improves your focus and helps you think more clearly. For instance, I read that just

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,680
 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day can enhance the part of your brain responsible for learning and

48
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,360
 memory, the hippocampus. That's amazing. I guess exercise isn't just about looking fit. It's about

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,880
 feeling sharp too. Absolutely. Physical movement helps the brain release endorphins, which reduce stress and improve

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,840
 overall mood. So the next time you feel stuck or tired while studying, try a quick stretch or a short

51
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,920
 walk. Not only will you feel refreshed, but you'll also remember what you've learned more effectively. Wow. So training your

52
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:33,520
 brain isn't just about puzzles or studying. It's about keeping your whole lifestyle active and healthy. Exactly. And with consistent

53
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:42,640
 practice, you'll see results not only in learning English, but in your everyday life. Let's look at five helpful

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:52,920
 phrases from today's discussion. One, brain boost, an activity that improves the performance of your brain. Example, meditation is a great

55
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:05,800
 brain boost because it helps you focus better. Two, memory hack, a trick or method to remember things more easily. Example, using rhymes is a classic memory hack for

56
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:19,200
 learning new words. Three, keep your mind sharp to stay mentally alert and focused. Example, playing chess is a fun way to keep your mind sharp. Four, neuroplasticity, the

57
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:36,000
 brain's ability to adapt and change by learning new things. Example, learning a new instrument can enhance neuroplasticity and make your brain more adaptable. Five, daily challenge, a small task you do each day to

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,919
 improve your skills or brain power. Example, a daily challenge like solving a crossword puzzle can keep your brain active.

59
00:06:43,920 --> 00:07:13,840
 Let's discuss some of these ideas together. Why do you think physical exercise is often called a brain boost? Gwen, I think it's because exercise doesn't just help the body. It helps the brain too. Exactly. When we move, the blood flow to our brain increases, which helps us think more clearly. And it also improves memory, right? Right. I've noticed after a good walk, I can focus better on my work.

60
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:43,599
 Have you ever felt that way? Absolutely. It's like a mental reset button. Now here's another question. How can a daily challenge, like learning a new word, help improve your memory over time? That's an easy one. Repeating something every day strengthens the brain's neural connections. You're saying it's like building a stronger bridge in your mind? Exactly. And the more you practice, the easier it becomes to remember new things. That's a great way to put it.

61
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:58,720
 So what's one small daily challenge you'd recommend to our listeners, Leo? I'd say start with learning one new word a day and using it in a sentence. It's simple, but so effective. That sounds like a fun and easy challenge.

62
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:11,120
 Let's dive deeper into some habits that can truly train your brain. One fascinating aspect of brain training is how creativity can be a game changer.

63
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:26,000
 Creativity? That's interesting. Tell me more. I read about this study from Stanford that shows drawing or journaling helps activate different parts of the brain. That makes sense. It's like giving your brain a fun challenge, right?

64
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:36,880
 Exactly. Plus it's super relaxing, which is great for reducing stress. Another thing is social interactions. Did you know talking to others stimulates the brain?

65
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:50,080
 That's true. Even casual chats can improve memory and problem solving skills. Exactly. So calling a friend or joining a group activity isn't just fun. It's brain training.

66
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:00,320
 Let's also talk about humor. Laughing is one of the best ways to keep your brain engaged. Laughing? Now you're just trying to promote your jokes, aren't you?

67
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,560
 Well, yes, but science backs me up. Research shows laughter boosts endorphins, which help your brain focus and stay positive.

68
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:22,880
 All right, I'll give you that one. Laughter really is a great tool for brain health. Here's something fun. Studies show people who regularly engage in hobbies are more likely to stay mentally sharp as they age.

69
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:32,080
 That's a great reason to pick up painting or even gardening, right? Absolutely. And you don't have to be perfect at it. Just enjoy the process.

70
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
 So what hobby would you start to train your brain? Let us know in the comments.

71
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,280
 Speaking of hobbies, Gwen, did you know that playing a musical instrument can actually change the structure of your brain?

72
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,680
 Really? That sounds fascinating. What's the science behind it?

73
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,839
 Well, I read a study from Harvard that shows musicians have more gray matter in certain parts of their brain.

74
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,319
 Gray matter? That's the part of the brain responsible for things like memory and muscle control, right?

75
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:12,400
 Exactly. So even practicing for 10 to 15 minutes a day can strengthen those areas. That's such a simple and effective way to train your brain.

76
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,920
 And not just instruments. Did you know that learning a new language can delay cognitive decline as you age?

77
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,160
 I've heard about that. The University of Edinburgh did a study showing bilingual people have better memory and multitasking skills.

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,800
 Exactly. It's like giving your brain a workout every time you switch between languages.

79
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:42,319
 Speaking of switching, multitasking is another way to keep your brain active, but only if done correctly.

80
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:45,359
 What do you mean by correctly?

81
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:52,560
 I mean focusing on related tasks. For example, while listening to a podcast, try summarizing it aloud.

82
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
 It's like engaging multiple parts of your brain at once.

83
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,000
 That's smart. I might try that with this podcast, summarizing it for myself after we finish.

84
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,080
 Another important point is rest. The brain needs downtime to process and store information.

85
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,080
 Absolutely. That's why sleep is so crucial for memory and focus.

86
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,840
 Did you know a study by the National Sleep Foundation found that?

87
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,560
 People who sleep seven to nine hours perform better on cognitive tasks?

88
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,200
 I can totally see that. Whenever I get less than six hours of sleep, my brain feels like it's running on empty.

89
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,520
 It's like trying to drive a car with no fuel.

90
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,520
 So for those listening, make sure to prioritize rest as part of your brain training routine.

91
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,720
 Great advice. And remember, small steps, like picking up a hobby or getting enough sleep,

92
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
 can lead to big changes over time.

93
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,520
 Let's go over seven helpful phrases we use today.

94
00:11:54,319 --> 00:12:00,240
 One, gray matter. The part of the brain that handles memory, muscle control,

95
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,160
 and decision making. Example, playing chess can increase the gray matter in your brain.

96
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,560
 Two, cognitive decline. The process of losing mental abilities as you age.

97
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,520
 Example, learning a new language can help delay cognitive decline.

98
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,920
 Three, multitasking, doing multiple things at the same time, but focusing on related tasks for better results.

99
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,960
 Example, listening to a podcast while summarizing it allowed improves your brain's activity.

100
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
 Four, engage to actively participate or involve yourself in an activity.

101
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,400
 Example, to keep your brain sharp, engage in mind-challenging games like Sudoku.

102
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,920
 Five, bilingual. Being able to speak two languages fluently. Example, bilingual people tend to have

103
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,439
 better problem-solving skills. Six, alternate to switch between two or more things regularly.

104
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:10,319
 Example, alternating between writing with your left and right hand can train your brain in unique ways.

105
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:20,320
 Seven, stimulate to encourage or trigger activity in the brain. Example, solving puzzles stimulates creative thinking.

106
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,080
 Now, let's reflect on two questions for today's discussion.

107
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,240
 Question one, what are some simple ways to train your brain based on today's discussion?

108
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,520
 Hmm, let's see. I think learning a new language is a great start, like English.

109
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,360
 Absolutely. It's not just useful, but it also pushes your brain to work in new ways.

110
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,280
 And don't forget about mind games like Sudoku or chess. They're like a workout for your brain.

111
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,200
 Oh, I love Sudoku. It really makes you think differently. Do you play any of these Leo?

112
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,200
 I try, but honestly, I'm better at summarizing things like a podcast episode. That's my go-to brain exercise.

113
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,480
 That's a great idea. Summarizing helps with memory and organizing thoughts.

114
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,360
 Question two, how can physical exercise help your brain?

115
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,320
 Oh, I read that even a simple walk can boost blood flow to your brain.

116
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,960
 Yes, and yoga is another great option. It helps release hormones that improve memory and

117
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,520
 focus. That's true. After a quick walk or stretch, I always feel refreshed and ready to tackle

118
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,760
 new ideas. Me too. It's a great reminder that taking care of your body really supports your brain.

119
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 What about you listeners? Do you have a favorite way to train your brain?

122
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,800
 brain training helpful and inspiring. Remember, whether it's learning a new skill,
